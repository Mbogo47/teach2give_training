# 🌍 Nationality Guesser App

This is a simple web application that predicts the most likely countries associated with a given name using the [Nationalize.io API](https://nationalize.io/). 

The app takes a user-inputted name, sends a request to the API, and returns a list of countries along with the probability that people with the name come from those countries.
